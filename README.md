## Overview of the project
The purpose of the project was to analyze temperature data, specifically in December and June,  in order to support the decision about opening ice-cream shop in Hawaii. Raw data was provided as a SQLite database file. 
## Results
June Temperatures

As evidenced by two screenshots above, there is 3.9  degree difference betweeen mean temperatures in June and December, with June being a warmer month.
Maximum temperatures differ only by 2 degrees
The biggest difference is observed in minimum temperatures, where the tempartures differ by 8 degrees. 

## Summary
With previous findings, it can be concluded that the weather in Hawaii stays warm year round to support ice-cream shop with median and maximum temperatures vary slightly in June and December. Even with the minimum temperatures in the 50s in December, it is still well above freezing to support ice-cream shop.
## Future recommendations 
In order to gain deeper understanding of weather patterns in Hawaii, it would be beneficial to explore precipitations pattern in June and December.
